    // This means it acts like a wire with zero resistance.

    // If it's an ideal inductor, and node1 is 'k' and node2 is 'm', and the current through
    // the inductor is I_L (a new variable), the equations would be:
    // V_k - V_m = 0 (for DC, or V_k - V_m = L * dI_L/dt for transient)
    // The KCL equations at node k and m would include I_L.
